# DKJS

Problems:

Animations disappear after each frame (clearRect is possibly being called at the wrong time).

Points need to be only gotten if Mario is within a certain range above a barrel.

The title screen logo is very inconsistent in terms of showing up (hitting refresh a couple of times makes it show up eventually).

Whilst the title screen is displayed, the game (specifically the barrels) are still working in the background. This results in the barrels being off sync from Donkey Kong's animation.

Having a way to freeze the game at certain points would make the game transitions feel less sudden.
