This is my final year project for my Computer Science course at De Montford University. It is a recreation of the first level of the original Donkey Kong arcade game, built entirely using vanilla JavaScript.

The project takes an Object-oriented approach by having multiple classes called by a main class. Each class has a specific role and responsibility, contributing to the overall functionality of the game.

I have added Luigi as a playable character and also made a character select screen. This is something I always thought was missing from the original.
